6.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Django
    python manage.py runserver

    # Example for Node.js (Express)
    npm start
    # or
    node server.js
    ```

7.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

8.  **Access the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend development server URL (usually `http://localhost:3000` or similar).
